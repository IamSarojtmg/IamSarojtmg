<h1 align="center">Hello, I am Saroj Tamang</h1>
<p align="center">I'm a Full Stack Developer specializing in <b>JavaScript, React, and Node.js</b>, for frontend development. On the backend, I have worked with <b>Express, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Mongoose</b>. My proficiency with <b>Git</b> and <b>GitHub</b> ensures seamless collaboration and efficient project delivery. Recently, my projects have incorporated <b>Test-Driven Development (TDD)</b> using <b>Jest</b> and I am currently exploring <b>TypeScript</b>, <b>GoLang</b>, and <b>HTMX</b> to further enhance my skills. In my previous role as an IT Service Desk Support, I excelled at managing multiple tickets simultaneously, resolving technical desktop issues, and promptly addressing incidents. This experience deepened my technical knowledge and enhanced my understanding of computing. As a senior team member, I was responsible for training and leading new colleagues, significantly improving my leadership abilities. I have 9 months of experience in the software development industry, having built applications for North Coders and worked as a front-end freelancer for a start-up. You can view examples of my work on my GitHub or my portfolio (clever-florentine-15c35a.netlify.app/) I'm looking forward to talking with you and discussing how I can contribute to your team's success.</p>
